Milestone 1 of SDV602 Project

Implement tests scripts that run three DESs (36 marks)
Six marks per screen. Each DES:
• accepts correct input and displays correct information (8 marks)

• provides navigation to other DESs, must include a top command interface to display them all (8 marks)

The screens must run without presenting errors.
